## 📐 Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

### ADR 001: Selection of Tech Stack & Multi-chain Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
Tradazone aims to provide a seamless invoicing and payment experience across disparate blockchain ecosystems (Stellar, Starknet, EVM). This requires a frontend architecture that is highly performant, scalable, and capable of managing complex, asynchronous multi-chain states while maintaining a premium user interface.

**Decision**:
We have adopted the following core architectural components:
1.  **Foundation**: **React 19** and **Vite 7**.
2.  **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS v3** for a utility-first design system.
3.  **State Management**: **React Context API** for global state (Auth and Data).
4.  **Integration Strategy**: A **Unified `AuthContext`** that abstracts blockchain-specific wallet logic (Freighter, Starknet.js, Ethers.js) into a single authentication interface.

**Rationale**:
- **Why Vite 7?**: Superior development velocity via instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and highly optimized production builds using Rollup, essential for modern dApp development workflows.
- **Why React 19?**: Future-proofing the application with modern primitives (Actions, Transitions) that simplify the handling of asynchronous blockchain transactions and state updates.
- **Why Tailwind CSS?**: Facilitates the creation of a "premium" aesthetic with zero runtime CSS overhead, ensuring the application remains fast even as the UI complexity grows.
- **Why Context API?**: After evaluating Redux and Zustand, the native Context API was chosen for its simplicity and direct alignment with React 19’s data-fetching patterns, which is sufficient for the application's current and projected state complexity.
- **Why Unified Auth?**: Centralizing multi-chain logic in a single `AuthContext` reduces component-level complexity, simplifies protected route management, and provides a consistent developer experience when adding support for new networks.

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Lightweight bundle size, ultra-fast UI response times, and a clear, modular architecture that lowers the barrier to entry for new contributors.
- **Negative**: Requires manual implementation of complex side effects that more prescriptive state management libraries would otherwise automate.

### ADR-002: API Gateway Stack Selection (Implementation Reference)

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-03-24
- **Context:** The app currently runs in frontend-only mode with mock data, but feature modules (`customers`, `invoices`, `checkouts`, `items`) already depend on a stable API boundary.
- **Decision:** Keep a centralized JavaScript API gateway module in `src/services/api.js`, using `VITE_API_URL` for runtime base URL configuration and mock-backed async methods until backend endpoints are ready.
- **Consequences:** UI pages can evolve independently from backend readiness and move to real endpoints incrementally by replacing gateway methods. Tradeoff: temporary mock parity maintenance is required.

## 🔧 Developer Setup Notes

### Modifying `ProfileSettings`

`ProfileSettings` lives in `src/pages/settings/ProfileSettings.jsx` and depends on:
- `useAuth()` from `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` (for initial `name`/`email`)
- Reusable form controls in `src/components/forms/Input` and `src/components/forms/Button`

Recommended local workflow before editing:

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Optional quality checks before pushing
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Implementation notes:
- Keep `formData` keys aligned with field names used in `handleChange`.
- Preserve controlled inputs (`value` + `onChange`) to avoid React state drift.
- If introducing persistence, wire submit logic through `src/services/api.js` (or context action) rather than direct component-level side effects.
- Validate mobile behavior for the `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` layout.

Manual test checklist after edits:
- Navigate to Settings > Profile and confirm existing user name/email are prefilled.
- Edit each field and verify updates are reflected in local component state.
- Submit and verify there are no runtime errors in the browser console.
